# Marp Demo

Trying out Marp presentation tool. This repo shows how to use the [https://marp.app/](https://marp.app/) tool. Please take a look in the presentation folder for the presentation itself. This repo also uses GitHub actions to build a site and post the presentation in different formats, e.g., PDF and Power Point. The GH Page is located at [https://fredrkl.github.io/marp-demo/](https://fredrkl.github.io/marp-demo/) and uses the _gh-pages_ branch.
